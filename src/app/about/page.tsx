        <p>Hi, I'm Faiza, a passionate web developer and designer with a love for creativity and code. With skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and frameworks like Next.js and Tailwind CSS, I bring ideas to life by blending technology with elegant, user-centered design. I'm currently honing my skills in UI/UX design while building apps and websites that deliver seamless experiences. Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring science, reading thought-provoking books, and diving into the mysteries of the world.</p>
