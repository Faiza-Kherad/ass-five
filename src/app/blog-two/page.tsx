      <p>When I first began my UI design journey, I wasn’t sure where it would take me. Armed with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I knew I had the technical tools. But UI design? That felt like stepping into the unknown.

        As I dove into Next.js, I realized that design and functionality are two sides of the same coin. Tailwind CSS made it easier to implement responsive designs, and with each project, my perspective on the role of aesthetics in web development evolved. It wasn’t just about making a site look good—it was about crafting an experience that would guide users seamlessly through content.

        The real breakthrough came when I stopped focusing solely on design rules and started thinking about user emotions. How do people feel when they interact with a website? What makes them linger? Every color, every button, every transition became a story in itself.Learning UI design taught me that creativity and logic are intertwined. It’s a dance of intuition and calculation, of beauty and practicality, and I’m loving every step of it.
